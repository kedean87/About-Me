# üëã Kevin Edward Dean ‚Äî Data Scientist | Principal Engineer | Innovator

Welcome to my professional portfolio repository.  
This page serves as an overview of my career, philosophy, and technical body of work ‚Äî providing context behind my professional journey and linking to my [career presentation (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OTn4FGuy-RpomlOSttQpGxnbBXm7HQq_/view?usp=sharing).

## üß≠ Introduction

I‚Äôm **Kevin Edward Dean**, a self-taught **Data Scientist, Engineer, and Innovator** with a career built on adaptability, creativity, and exploration.  
Throughout my journey ‚Äî from **muon tomography and 3D visualization** to **machine learning pipelines and generative AI systems** ‚Äî my guiding philosophy has been simple:

> ‚ÄúJust because I don‚Äôt know it today doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt know it tomorrow.‚Äù

This mindset has allowed me to thrive in high-paced startup environments, lead cross-functional technical teams, and innovate within domains where the solution wasn‚Äôt yet defined.

## üå± Personal Philosophy

I‚Äôm a **visual learner** fascinated by the relationship between data and reality ‚Äî how numbers, patterns, and structures reveal truths about the world around us.

I believe in:
- **Active pattern recognition** ‚Äî identifying recurring challenges across projects and anticipating systemic solutions.  
- **Transparent leadership** ‚Äî mediating between management and junior engineers to ensure clarity, communication, and direction.  
- **Continuous learning** ‚Äî investing in open-ended exploration through papers, design docs, and peer review.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the facilitator‚Äôs job to solve every problem ‚Äî it‚Äôs to improve the quality of the team‚Äôs decision process.‚Äù

## üß© Technical Leadership & Best Practices

In my leadership roles (Senior Data Scientist, Principal Engineer, Director of Engineering), I‚Äôve emphasized **clarity, reproducibility, and mentorship**.

### Responsibilities:
- Mediated between upper management and engineering teams  
- Supervised backend C++ library and ML model integration  
- Mentored engineers across multiple departments  
- Managed machine learning pipelines and unstructured data assets  
- Conducted interviews, onboarding, and training  
- Proven impact through measurable statistical and visual analyses  

### Guiding Practices:
- Protect uninterrupted time for deep work  
- Document everything (algorithms, complexity, assumptions)  
- Promote reproducible and traceable code practices  
- Encourage conferences, learning, and knowledge sharing  
- Define clear project ownership and outcome accountability

## üî¨ Major Technical Contributions

### **1. Neural ML ‚Äî Point Cloud Classification API**
Developed a machine learning API for **3D scene classification and segmentation**.  
- Each neuron represented a decomposed point cloud  
- Outperformed standard ML APIs in speed and accuracy  
- Achieved **99% accuracy on ShapeNet** and **80% on ModelNet40**

**Outcome:** Top-5 category relations validated through covariance matching before SVM classification.

### **2. Mutable Tree Data Structure (MTDS)**
Invented and patented (US 11670052 B1) a **data structure for high-performance spatial computing**.  
- Achieved frame rate improvements from **99 FPS ‚Üí 850 FPS** ; this was a second to final revision where I was profiling the way the mutable tree was gridded. As opposed to equivalent subvolumes per search tree, I created more variable sized volumes in slices similar to how DICOM (from what I've seen in the past) images are generated. Using a `Gaussian-style Traversal`, I was able to improve the frames per second from 405 fps to ~850 fps.
- Enabled real-time 3D visualization of massive point clouds (31B points)  
- Used in human brain tomography visualization at ESRF dataset

### **3. 3D Language Curator Project**
Personal initiative inspired by my autistic sons, combining:
- **Generative AI (LLMs)** for contextual responses  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** for vocal learning feedback  
- **3D avatar animation** using Wav2Lip & SadTalker  

**Goal:** Build a multimodal learning system to help neurodiverse children develop language and social understanding.

### **4. Visualization and Simulation Engineering**
At **Decision Sciences** and **DAAC**, I contributed to:
- Muon tomography 3D reconstruction using deep learning  
- Health analysis visualization of detector systems  
- High-performance computing (HPC) simulation jobs across 55+ (Decision Sciences), 5000+ (DAAC; DoD) nodes  
- 3D Lidar fusion and container localization  
- Visualization pipelines for missile fluid dynamics and jet simulation
